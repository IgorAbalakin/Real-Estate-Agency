### Project Description 

*Business task*:Â to determine the characteristics for quickly estimating the value of a real estate object, without wasting time sorting ads and searching for profitable offers, that would allow to bypass competitors in terms of speed and quality of transactions.

*Technical task*: to create a machine learning model that based on the proposed features of a real estate object will predict its value..

### Data cleaning

       1. Removing duplicates
       2. Filling in gaps (medians and modes)
       3. Removal of emissions in two stages: by the three sigma method and the Tukey method
       4. Removal of correlated features

### Exploration Data Analysis (EDA)

In this part of the project, we need to perform:

        1. Research data
        2. Search for patterns that allow us to formulate preliminary hypotheses about which factors are decisive for the trip duration
        3. Create visualizations that illustrate this study.
